Almost every developer uses open source code. But not every organization has an open source policy or a formal program to manage how it is used or produced. The TODO Group has partnered with The Newstack to build the first ever open source programs survey.

Some of the questions we ask include:

* If your organization does not have an open source program, why not?
* What are the challenges and benefits of an open source program?
* How critical is an open source program to your engineering success?
* How is open source code managed?
* And more!

Thank you for helping us collect the best data possible!
