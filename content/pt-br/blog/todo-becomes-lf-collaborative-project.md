Yesterday, the TODO Group announced new members (Autodesk, CapitalOne, Netflix, and SanDisk) and moving to the Linux Foundation as a [Collaborative Project](http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org/):

We are excited as this move will help formalize the group legally (see our [charter](https://github.com/todogroup/charter)) and allow us to scale the group with additional members. The Linux Foundation provides a great home for us and is a very trusted host with collaborative projects such as the [NodeJS Foundation](http://www.nodejs.org), [Open Container Initiative](http://opencontainers.org) and [LetsEncrypt](https://www.letsencrypt.org). Also, we look forward to sharing open source program management best practices and tools with the 600+ Linux Foundation members.

If you're interested in collaborating with other companies who are building open source programs, consider [joining](http://todogroup.org/join/) the TODO Group. We look forward to collaborating with you!
